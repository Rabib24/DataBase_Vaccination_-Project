                <p>Your child should receive their first doses of most vaccines during their first two years of life. They may need several doses of the vaccines to reach full protection. For example, the CDC recommends children receive their first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months of age or older. They should then receive a second dose before entering elementary school (about 4 to 6 years of age). By the age of 15 months, your baby may receive up to 10 different types of vaccines. The Pediatrics recommends all healthy babies must receive these initial vaccines. Your child may receive additional doses and other vaccines between the ages of 15 months and 16 years old. If your child has a chronic condition or a weakened immune system, their pediatrician may recommend a different schedule.</p>

              <p>Note: The sight of your baby getting a shot may make you cry along with them. But getting your child vaccinated according to the childhood immunization schedule is the best way to protect them against many different infections and diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Protection and the American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend following a specific immunization schedule. However, talk to your childâ€™s pediatrician to find out what works best for your child.</p>
